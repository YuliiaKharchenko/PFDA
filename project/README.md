## Project Objectives:

1. Analyse historical wind speed data across Ireland.
2. Determine optimal locations for wind farms based on wind speed trends and operational ranges.
3. Identify potential future wind power trends and variability.
4. Explore other weather metrics (e.g., temperature, rainfall) that might influence wind farm operations.

| **Minimum Project**            |                                                                                                   |
| 1. Read in/acquire/make up, a number of good data sets |                                                                           |
| 2. Analyse the data using various techniques, we have covered in this module|                                                      |
| 3. Some nice-looking plots to illustrate our findings. |                                                                           |
| **Features we can add**        |                                                                                                   |
| 1. Increase the range of data we are analysing |                                                                                   |
| 2. Use more features of SciKitLearn and other packages that we find useful |                                                       |
| 3. Provide meaningful insights    |                                                                                                |
| 4. Increase the complexity of our plots without reducing readability |                                                             |
| 5. Use a database                 |                                                                                                |
